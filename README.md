# Repository to track my evolution in learning C Programming

I started to learn C programming on the CS50 course from EdX. 
There, they recommend a book called [C Programming Absolute Beginners Guide](http://j.mp/c_programming_beginner) and in this repository I mainly solve the problems from this book.

During my journey I'm assisted by [Tudor Constantin](http://programming.tudorconstantin.com/?utm_source=dragos)
